.Description of the project
This is a simple 4 button panio. The buzzer is going to buzz the tones of C, D, E,
and G. I will be using the builtin Library tone(). tone(pin, frequency, duration).
I wrote a function to turn on the on board LED (Pin 13) to show that the button
is pressed. This will help with debugging. The frequencies I used are: C = 440Hz,
D = 493.883Hz, E = 554.365Hz, and G = 659.255Hz. Doe, Re, Mi, and Sol.  

.Items Needed
* Four Push button
* One Arduino R3 
* One Breadboard
* Eleven jumper wires

.Circuit Design
On the breadboard I installed the four push buttons at the bottom of my breadboard. With
the rows listed as F, G, H, I, and J. Here are the columns I installed the buttons:
Button C - left two legs into column 55, right legs into column 53. Button D - left two
legs into column 45, right legs into column 43. Button E - left two legs into column 35,
right legs into column 33. Button G - left two legs into column 25, right legs into 
column 23. The passive buzzer positive leg is installed into column 20 on the upper rows
of the breadboard - rows A, B, C, D, and E. With the GND leg into column 23. Now for the 
jumper wires. I ran the GND from the Arduino to the GND rail on the breadboard. I ran pin
2 to column 55. Pin 3 to column 45. Pin 4 to column 35. Pin 5 to column 25. Pin 9 to column
20. The GND jumper wires are: column 53 to GND rail. Column 43 to GND rail. Column 33 to 
GND rail. Column 23 to GND rail. Column 23 to GND rail. The circuit is now wired up.

.Code
The code for this project is in the file called "SimplePanio.ino".

.What To Expect
This project will take the button reading and tell the IC to play a frequency based off
the button Value. The function of tone() does the heavy lifting in this project. You can
